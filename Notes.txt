			Bottom line this is a 6to4 adapter and IPv6 issue.

1. Turn off wireless and connect via network cable.									x

2. Disable IPv6 in Windows 7 http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852					X

To disable certain IPv6 components yourself, follow these steps:
Run Regedit
In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry subkey:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters\
Double-click DisabledComponents to modify the DisabledComponents entry.

Note If the DisabledComponents entry is unavailable, you must create it.
To do this, follow these steps:
In the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD (32-bit) Value.
Type DisabledComponents, and then press ENTER.
Double-click DisabledComponents.
Type any one of the following values to configure the IPv6 protocol, and
then click OK:
Type 0xffffffff to disable all IPv6 components, except the IPv6 loopback
interface. This value also configures Windows Vista to use Internet
Protocol version 4 (IPv4) instead of IPv6 in prefix policies.

3. Remove all the 6to4 adapters in Device Manager found under Network
Adapters.  This can be done manually (but can be quite time consuming)
or you can use the devcon utility found here
http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=311272
Devcon remove *6TO4MP*

4. Apply the following hotfix to prevent Windows 7 from generating
multiple 6TO4 adapters.  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980486/

5. Reboot, turn wireless back on and test your connections.
